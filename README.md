# Thicket
Thicket is cross-platform software for card game drafting.

Thicket uses a client/server architecture to guarantee fairness; the server maintains the state of drafts and players while clients receive only the information they are allowed to know.

To get started, download the [latest release](http://github.com/mildmongrel/thicket/releases/latest) of the client.

Visit the [project wiki](http://github.com/mildmongrel/thicket/wiki) for more project information.
